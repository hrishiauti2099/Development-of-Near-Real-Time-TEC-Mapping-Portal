Integrate with editors
Enhance your Nx experience by installing Nx Console for your favorite editor. Nx Console provides an interactive UI to view your projects, run tasks, generate code, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and comes with a LSP for Vim users.

Start the application
Run npx nx serve api to start the development server. Happy coding!

Build for production
Run npx nx build api to build the application. The build artifacts are stored in the output directory (e.g. dist/ or build/), ready to be deployed.

Running tasks
To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

npx nx <target> <project> <...options>
You can also run multiple targets:

npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
..or add -p to filter specific projects

npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
Targets can be defined in the package.json or projects.json. Learn more in the docs.
